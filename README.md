Phprunner Hints and Modifications

As I have been using PHP Runner for years, I wanted to share some of the things I have learned through several projects.

From database connections to IP restrictions built into your code, its been a learning experiance to get this far.

I will add samples of my code and might share some projects for you to try on your own.
